SmartX and Alauda recently announced that the compatibility certification has been achieved for the persistent storage solution for containers. According to a test result, SmartX’s cloud native storage product IOMesh is fully compatible with Alauda Container Platform (ACP) V3.4.1.

As an innovative leader in the enterprise-grade cloud native field in China, Alauda has built ACP, a new generation of open, full-stack private cloud platform. Through Kubernetes and other cloud native technologies, Alauda helps customers accelerate the development, operation, and management of modern applications.

SmartX's cloud native storage product IOMesh, announced in June this year, is specifically designed and developed for Kubernetes. It possesses cloud-native characteristics including containerized deployment, automatic operation, declarative APIs, as well as demonstrates excellent performance and stability. IOMesh is the first storage product in China that has achieved Red Hat OpenShift certification.

The compatibility certification for IOMesh and ACP not only provides a new choice for ACP users to deploy persistent storage for containers in the production environment, but also further expands the container ecosystem.
